My Description

My name is Paulo DÃ¼rbeck, and I am currently a Junior game designer with a Bachelor's in Games and Multimedia. I'm currently (As of February 2024) working on improving my portfolio by developing prototypes with a small group of talanted individuals during our free time, while seeking for internship opportunities to further enhance my abilities and advance my personal career.

I've had many connections with the world of games before, though from different areas.
I've organized some small tournaments and events before, as well as commentate on various different tournaments for a couple of fighting games, with the organizers "SaltyEU".
I have also worked with Nintendo of Portugal, both officially and unofficially in order to organize tournaments or other smaller events.
In the topic of eSports, I have also previously managed a Tekken 7 Competitive team for about a year, being both the team manager as well as the trainer for the players.

I possess skills in softwares such as Adobe Premiere, Audition, Xd, Photoshop, Maya, Blender, Unreal Engine 4/5, Unity, Excel, Miro and Trello as well as some other flowcharting tools.
I've also created a fair ammount of Game design documents, and Rational Game Design Documents as well.
